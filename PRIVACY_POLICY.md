Privacy Policy for Finlight
Effective Date: August 4, 2025

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Finlight (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Prajwal Madhyastha.

Our Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is our top priority. Finlight is designed as a privacy-first, offline-first application. All of your financial data, including transactions, accounts, and budgets, is stored exclusively on your local device. We do not have a server, and your personal financial information is never collected, stored, or transmitted to us or any third party.

Information the Application Accesses and Its Use
1. SMS (Text Messages) - READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS
   Finlight requests permission to read and receive SMS messages for one core purpose: to automatically detect and import financial transactions from bank and service provider messages.

How it works: The Application uses on-device intelligence to scan incoming SMS messages for patterns that indicate a financial transaction (e.g., debits, credits, purchases).

What is used: When a transactional SMS is identified, the Application extracts only the necessary information, such as the amount, merchant name, and date, to create a new transaction entry within the app.

What is NOT used: The content of your personal, non-transactional messages is completely ignored and never read or stored.

2. Camera - CAMERA
   The Application requests camera permission to allow you to attach images of receipts or documents to your transactions. These images are stored locally on your device alongside the transaction data and are not transmitted elsewhere.

3. Notifications - POST_NOTIFICATIONS
   The Application requests permission to send notifications to provide you with daily, weekly, and monthly spending summaries, as well as alerts for recurring transactions or newly detected patterns.

Data Storage and Security
All data you enter into Finlight, or that is generated from your SMS messages, is stored in a secure, private database on your device's internal storage. The security of your data is directly tied to the security of your device itself.

Third-Party Services
The Application uses Firebase Crashlytics to help us identify and fix crashes. This service collects anonymous, non-personally identifiable crash reports. No personal financial data is ever included in these reports.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Application and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
